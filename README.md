# AoC2017
Advent of Code 2017

I do these quickly for the first pass (the only way to get leader board points) so please don't take that as an example of production code.

Naming conventions:

day_01/p1.py  # day 1 good-enough-to-post solution
day_01/p1_prod.py  # [optional] cleaned up version of p1.py with yucky parts removed
day_01/p1_prod_ann.py  # [optional] p1_prod.py with inline comments and alternate solutions

I don't like putting maybe one file in a directory, so I'm trying this as an experiment.

I threw an SSD towards the end of the month so I actually lost a bunch of code. When in doubt `git push`!!
